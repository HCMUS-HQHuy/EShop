*   **Type-Safe Codebase:** The entire project is written in **TypeScript** from front to back, minimizing runtime errors and enhancing maintainability.

### üöÄ Performance & Real-Time
*   **High-Performance Order Queue:** Using **Redis** and **BullMQ**, the system can handle a high volume of concurrent orders, ensuring fairness and stability, especially during flash sale events.
*   **Real-Time Chat:** Users and sellers can communicate instantly through a chat system built with **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**.
*   **Automated Tasks (Cron Jobs):** Scheduled tasks, such as expiring verification tokens and cleaning up old messages, are automated with **cron jobs**, keeping the system efficient and clean.
